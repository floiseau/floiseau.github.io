Currently, they primarily revolve around the modelling and simulation of damage and fracture in structures. In my research, I place a strong emphasis on establishing a solid mathematical foundation for the models and simulations.\nKeywords : Damage Mechanics, Anisotropy, Computational Mechanics, Fracture Mechanics."

I hold dual Master’s degrees in Mechanics of Materials and Teaching of Mechanics, both obtained from ENS Paris-Saclay. Following my Masters, I completed my Ph.D. at Paris-Saclay University, where I focused on the modeling of anisotropic damage in quasi-brittle materials and structures using discrete element simulations as a reference. My research was conducted at the LMPS within ENS Paris-Saclay under the supervision of Rodrigue Desmorat and Cécile Oliver-Leblond."
