### Open-source dataset

During my Ph.D. thesis, I generated and made public a dataset of effective elasticity tensor obtained from discrete element simulations. This dataset is hosted in the RechercheDataGouv repository ([https://doi.org/10.57745/LYHM4W](https://doi.org/10.57745/LYHM4W)) and can be freely used for research.
